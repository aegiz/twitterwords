# twitterwords
A phantomJs / casperJs project which scan the twitter profile of a given list of words


## IDEA : 

Use it to scan the names per country

## Strategy :

A first script (dev/main1.js) is getting all the existing occurences. 
A second script (dev/main2.js) can help really checking if the word exist or not (but there is a limit...)


##TODO :

- create a script which is getting how many tweets have been posted by a user and when he registered
- See if there is a correlation with the number of new subscribers in Twitter.
